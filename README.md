TelemX is a visual interface and dashboard to view past and live SpaceX telemetry data from various launches, vehicles, and locations. It is a Javascript, HTML, CSS, and React project designed to showcase fetching data from an API and displaying it in a user friendly fashion.

All credit for the incredibly data rich and well maintained Launch Library API goes to The Space Devs. Please checkout out their work at the API link seen below. A special thanks goes out to Lucabon for his work on the Falcon SVG art, link and credit below
