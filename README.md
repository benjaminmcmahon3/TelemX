TelemX is a visual interface and dashboard to view past or live SpaceX telemetry data from various launches, vehicles, and locations. It is a Javascript, HTML, CSS, and React project designed to showcase fetching data from an API and displaying it in a user friendly fashion.

All credit for the incredibly data rich and well maintained API containing live and archived SpaceX telemetry goes to all the folks contributing to this open source project. Please checkout out their work at the link above.
